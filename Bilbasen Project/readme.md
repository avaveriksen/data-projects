I scraped 1800 car adverts from a query on Bilbasen.dk, a prominent website primarily for buying used cars. I scraped with Selenium in Python. Coming up I will do some analysis on the data set, primarily in MATLAB. I might make a PowerBI report on it as well.

The analysis can most easily be read in the [pdf](https://github.com/avaveriksen/data-projects/blob/main/Bilbasen%20Project/data_analysis.pdf). The analysis proposes an exponential model dependent on age and kilometers driven for the **Citr√∂en C4**. This is used to come up with a metric for each car, **VOD** (value of deal), basically quantifying whether you get the value you pay for, more or less. Also, the model is used to calculate the depreciation of the value of the car, such that an estimate for the cost of ownership over three years with 20000 kms added, is considered.
