Data, Python, Scraping, PowerBI, MATLAB

## [Citroën C4 project](https://github.com/avaveriksen/data-projects/tree/main/citroen-c4-project)
I try to get some insights into the market for a used car, specifically the Citroën C4. I scrape data with **Selenium** in **Python**, transform, visualize and report on it with **Power BI**, and do some deeper analysis with **MATLAB**.

## [Color schemer Image processing project](https://github.com/avaveriksen/data-projects/tree/main/Image%20Processing)
I wrote a **MATLAB** script to open an image and extract color values from the pixels of the image, ultimately to make some color pallettes which would be useful for creating themes in presentation tools like Powerpoint, PowerBI, or anywhere else where you want to match a color scheme to an image. The project has lots of **array indexing**, some fairly **advanced plotting**, and working with **images in MATLAB**.

## [Bilbasen data project](https://github.com/avaveriksen/data-projects/tree/main/Bilbasen%20Project)
So far, I scraped 1800 car adverts from a query on Bilbasen.dk, a prominent website primarily for buying used cars. I scraped with Selenium in Python. I analyse the data in **MATLAB**, and use **Regression** to come up with a model for the relative-to-new value of a car, dependent on age and kilometers driven.
