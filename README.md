## [Citroën C4 project](https://github.com/avaveriksen/data-projects/tree/main/citroen-c4-project)
I try to get some insights into the market for a used car, specifically the Citroën C4. I scrape data with **Selenium** in **Python**, transform, visualize and report on it with **Power BI**, and do some deeper analysis with **MATLAB**.

## [Color schemer Image processing project](https://github.com/avaveriksen/data-projects/tree/main/Image%20Processing)
I wrote a MATLAB script to open an image and extract color values from the pixels of the image, ultimately to make some color pallettes which would be useful for creating themes in presentation tools like Powerpoint, PowerBI, or anywhere else where you want to match a color scheme to an image.
